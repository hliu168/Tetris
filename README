Build and Run Project:
# sudo apt install qt5-default
# qmake -project
- Then add following 2 lines to Tetris.pro
    QT += widgets
    CONFIG += c++11
# qmake
# make
# ./Tetris

Project Chosen: Simple Tetris Game
- There are many aspects left to improve, 
    e.g. screen size and platform portability.
    e.g. student (myself) didn't have time to learn SDL and used limited existing knowledge of Qt instead.
- Also, due to the tight work schedule of student's full time job, he wasn't able to make a perfect game with all features.
- However, the student (myself) strived to fix all the bugs he found during this limited time.

Code Structure:
- TetrisModel describes the memory model of the game.
    - How game field and figure are described in memory
    - How game state was changed by each move (Key Up to rotate figure, Key Left, Key Right, Move Down
- TetrisViewController contains majority of the logic of view rendering and event processing
    - Qt events were used to intercept keyboard event and timer interrupt. 

Rubrics:
- The project demonstrates an understanding of C++ functions and control structures.
- The project accepts user input and processes the input. Key left (move left), right (move right), Key up (rotate)
- The project uses Object Oriented Programming techniques.
- Classes use appropriate access specifiers for class members.
- Classes abstract implementation details from their interfaces.
- Classes encapsulate behavior.
